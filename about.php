 <h2 class="display-4">Bharat Agri Portal</h2>
 <p class="py-3">“IF YOU ATE TODAY, THANK A FARMER”. In the Modern Era of technology, we may find
many technology development. “Without the development of farmers, nothing the development of nation”. This
will include the websites, portals and apps for different sectors. Our Farmers are the BACKBONE OF INDIAN
ECONOMY, but they does not have any proper recognition and technology services.
The main objective of our project BHARAT AGRI PORTAL is to make a farmer as an “ENTREPRENUR”. This
portal provides a bridge of communication between the farmers and the buyers without the interruption of
intermediator. And also the farmers can know about the basic things through this portal. By this portal the farmers
can fix the great price (as per government norm) for their greens and goods. In this portal the farmers also able to
upload the details such as availability of stock, demand and so on. “ONE MARKET FOR WHOLE
NATION:BUY CLEAN AND GREEN” in the Bharat Agri Portal the farmers can directly connected to the
buyers. This will help both the farmers and the buyers to increase their income and also the nation income. This
portal also helps the farmers to get knowledge of using the websites. This portal also teach them the basics of
computer and internet to access themselves. It was useful to know them how they can use the websites
In the farmer’s portal, a farmer will be able to get all the relevant information around his area of concern. This
information will be delivered in the form of text, SMS, E-mail and audio/video in any language that he/she
understands. Using this portal provides better profitability, secure transaction between buyer and seller, better
rates for greens and goods and Farmers invest their profit again to make food for us instead of investing it in bank
and most importantly “Every farmer can live with pride”.</p>
